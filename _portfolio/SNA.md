We investigate the network of scholarly collaboration in development economics in this
project. More specifically, we examine the pattern of collaboration in the co-authorship network
and scholar-implementer partnership network. Although collaboration also exists in the form of
commenting and a research assistantship, we decided to focus on co-authorship and research implementation
as these two types of collaboration are major factors in determining the overall structure
of newly submitted working papers that have not received peer review. For the co-authorship
network, we are interested in the following questions: 1) Who are the influential scholars in development
economics? 2) Are there any differential returns of social capital depending on gender
in the co-authorship network? If so, how does that affect productivity? 3) How the legitimacy of
a researcher in his/her co-authorship network affects his/her productivity? 4) What implementing
organizations do scholars usually partner with for the fieldwork of RCTs?
