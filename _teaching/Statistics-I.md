Description
======
This is the first quarter of the statistics sequence at the Harris School. This course aims to provide students
with a basic understanding of statistical analysis for policy research. We recognize that Harris students come
from a variety of academic backgrounds and real-world experiences. This course makes no assumptions
about prior knowledge of statistics or data science, apart from basic mathematics and coding skills
introduced in Math Camp. Students with more advanced backgrounds in statistics or econometrics may wish
to instead consider PPHA 31202, Advanced Statistics for Data Analysis I.
