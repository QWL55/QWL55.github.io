Description
======
The workshops aim to introduce R programming concepts with a focus on preparing and analyzing data, and conducting statistical simulations. We will cover how to read data into R, manipulate data with a suite of tools from the `tidyverse` package `dplyr`. We will also discuss some basic programming concepts including data types, operators, control flow with if statements and for loops, as well as how to write your own functions.
