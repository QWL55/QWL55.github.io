I am a Research Fellow (Computational Science) at [the Regulation, Evaluation, and Governance Lab (RegLab)](https://reglab.stanford.edu/), Stanford Law School, where I work on developing and validating computational methods to study racial disparities. I graduated with Honors from [Master of Science in Computational Analysis and Public Policy program](https://harris.uchicago.edu/academics/degrees/ms-computational-analysis-public-policy-mscapp) in 2022, a joint degree between the Harris School of Public Policy and Department of Computer Science at the University of Chicago. I focus on international development policy, public health, social inequality, and machine learning methods. Prior to that, I worked as a research consultant at the World Bank for [DIME](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/dime) and [SSI](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/socialsustainability) where I applied spatial data science methods to support field teams in geocoding in Delhi, India and identifying vulnerable populated regions in Ukraine. I received a B.S. with Distinction from the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor in Statistics and Political Science (with a minor in Economics) in 2020, where I applied statistical methods to examine factors associated with experience of intimate partner violence.
