Violence against women is a violation of human rights and among all forms of violence, intimate
partner violence (IPV) is considered to be the most common form (Devries et al.). This issue
is particularly salient in developing countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),
which is estimated to have the highest rate of reported violence (Cools and Kotsadam). IPV adversely
affects women's health and also creates negative externalities such as fear of abuse and
psychological stress for those who witness violence. The severity and negative consequences of
IPV highlight the need to understand factors associated with the prevalence of IPV and the importance
of proposing policy solutions to this issue. In this project, I used permutation tests and logistic
regression to explore whether in DRC women's probability of experiencing IPV is associated with
the following four individual-level characteristics of women: employment status, property ownership,
household wealth, years of education.
